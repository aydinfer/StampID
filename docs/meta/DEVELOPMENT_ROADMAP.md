# Development Roadmap - Expo Starter Template

> Epic-based development plan to deliver a 70% complete, production-ready template

## Philosophy

This template should provide **70% of the work out-of-the-box**, not just a skeleton. Users should be able to:

- Clone and run immediately
- Focus on customizing layouts and design
- Add their own screens
- Ship to production with minimal setup

## Status Overview

- ✅ **Completed**: EPICs 1-2 (Foundation & Common UI Components)
- 🚧 **In Progress**: EPIC 3 - Authentication System
- ⏳ **Pending**: EPICs 4-7

---

## EPIC 1: Foundation & Utilities ✅

**Goal**: Core utilities that all other features depend on

### Tasks

- [x] Animation presets (fadeIn, slideIn, scale, bounce, etc.)
- [x] Error boundary component with retry functionality
- [x] Format utilities (currency, date, phone, numbers)

### Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ All utilities have TypeScript types
- ✅ Animation presets use official Reanimated patterns
- ✅ Error boundary catches and logs errors gracefully

### Files Created

- [lib/animations/presets.ts](../../lib/animations/presets.ts) - Animation presets with Reanimated
- [components/ErrorBoundary.tsx](../../components/ErrorBoundary.tsx) - Error boundary component
- [lib/utils/format.ts](../../lib/utils/format.ts) - Format utilities

---

## EPIC 2: Common UI Components ✅

**Goal**: Reusable components used throughout the app

### Tasks

- [x] Avatar component (with image, initials fallback, sizes)
- [x] Badge component (notification counts, status indicators)
- [x] Skeleton loader component (for loading states)
- [x] EmptyState component (when lists/data are empty)
- [x] LoadingSpinner component (full-screen and inline variants)

### Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ All components use glass design system
- ✅ Components are accessible
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode passes
- ✅ Components work on iOS, Android, and web

### Files Created

- [components/ui/glass/GlassAvatar.tsx](../../components/ui/glass/GlassAvatar.tsx) - Avatar with initials fallback
- [components/ui/glass/GlassBadge.tsx](../../components/ui/glass/GlassBadge.tsx) - Badge with variants
- [components/ui/glass/GlassSkeleton.tsx](../../components/ui/glass/GlassSkeleton.tsx) - Skeleton loader with shimmer
- [components/ui/glass/GlassEmptyState.tsx](../../components/ui/glass/GlassEmptyState.tsx) - Empty state with templates
- [components/ui/glass/GlassLoadingSpinner.tsx](../../components/ui/glass/GlassLoadingSpinner.tsx) - Loading spinner variants

## EPIC 3: Authentication System

**Goal**: Complete auth flow ready for production

### Tasks

- [ ] Sign-in screen (email/password + social login buttons)
- [ ] Sign-up screen (with real-time validation)
- [ ] Forgot password screen (with email confirmation)
- [ ] Update useAuth hook (complete Supabase integration)

### Acceptance Criteria

- Forms have real-time validation using validation utilities
- Supabase integration is fully functional
- Error states are handled gracefully
- Loading states use glassmorphic components
- Social login buttons prepared (Apple, Google)

### Official Docs Used

- [Supabase Auth Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth)
- [Expo AuthSession](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/auth-session/)

## EPIC 4: Onboarding Flow

**Goal**: First-time user experience

### Tasks

- [ ] Onboarding screen 1: Welcome (app intro)
- [ ] Onboarding screen 2: Features (key features showcase)
- [ ] Onboarding screen 3: Permissions (notifications, location if needed)
- [ ] Pagination dots and skip/next logic

### Acceptance Criteria

- Smooth transitions between screens
- Skip button on all screens
- Completion tracked in AsyncStorage
- Only shown once (or when cleared)

---

## EPIC 5: Subscription & Monetization

**Goal**: Revenue generation ready to go

### Tasks

- [ ] **SKIP Paywall UI** - RevenueCat has PaywallView component
- [ ] Update useSubscription hook (complete RevenueCat integration)
- [ ] Subscription management screen (current plan, cancel, restore)

### Important Notes

**RevenueCat provides the paywall UI!** We should use their official PaywallView:

- [RevenueCat PaywallView Documentation](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/displaying-products)
- [React Native Purchases SDK](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/installation/reactnative)

### Acceptance Criteria

- RevenueCat is configured with app-specific API keys
- Subscription status is properly tracked
- Restore purchases works
- Graceful handling of subscription errors

### Official Docs Used

- [RevenueCat React Native SDK](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/installation/reactnative)
- [RevenueCat Paywall Configuration](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/displaying-products)

## EPIC 6: Core Application Screens

**Goal**: Main app functionality screens

### Tasks

- [ ] Real Settings screen (replace example with working version)
- [ ] Real Profile screen (view + edit mode, image upload)
- [ ] Notifications screen (list of user notifications)

### Acceptance Criteria

- Settings persist to AsyncStorage or Zustand
- Profile updates sync with Supabase
- Notifications use React Query for server state
- All screens use glassmorphic design

---

## EPIC 7: Documentation & Polish

**Goal**: Complete documentation for users and AI agents

### Tasks

- [ ] Update all docs with new components/screens
- [ ] Create CHANGELOG.md with version history
- [ ] Update README with complete feature list
- [ ] Add inline code documentation

### Acceptance Criteria

- All new components documented in API reference
- CHANGELOG follows Keep a Changelog format
- README accurately reflects current state
- LLM.txt is updated with all changes

---

## Technical Guidelines

### Always Use Official Documentation

- **Expo**: https://docs.expo.dev/
- **React Native**: https://reactnative.dev/docs/
- **Supabase**: https://supabase.com/docs
- **RevenueCat**: https://www.revenuecat.com/docs
- **React Query**: https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/overview
- **Reanimated**: https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/

### Code Standards

- TypeScript strict mode (no `any` types)
- NativeWind for all styling
- React Query for server state
- Zustand for client state
- Reanimated for animations
- Follow patterns in existing glass components

### Commit Strategy

- Complete one EPIC at a time
- Commit and push after each EPIC
- Update this roadmap with ✅ after completion
- Document breaking changes in CHANGELOG

---

## Definition of Done (per EPIC)

1. ✅ All tasks completed
2. ✅ TypeScript passes strict mode (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
3. ✅ Metro bundles without errors
4. ✅ Tested on iOS/Android/Web
5. ✅ Documentation updated
6. ✅ Committed and pushed to main

3. 🚧 In Progress: EPIC 2 (Common UI Components)
4. Continue systematically through EPICs 3-7

## Questions & Decisions

### RevenueCat Paywall

**Decision**: Use RevenueCat's official PaywallView component instead of building custom UI.

- Saves development time
- Automatically updates with offerings
- Handles localization
- Follows platform best practices

### Analytics

**Decision**: Not included by default. Can be added as optional setup.

- Keeps bundle size smaller
- Privacy-conscious
- Easy to add Mixpanel/PostHog/Amplitude later

### State Management

**Decision**: React Query + Zustand (already implemented)

- React Query for server state
- Zustand for client state
- No Redux complexity
